# üìö **MVC and ASP.NET Core 8 Project: Employee Portal**

This project demonstrates an **ASP.NET Core MVC** application that integrates **Entity Framework (EF)**, **.NET Core Identity**, **Web API**, and **SQL Server** to manage employee data. The application includes login functionality, CRUD operations for employees, a contact form with email notifications, and essential user interface components.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

- **User Authentication**: Login system with **.NET Core Identity**.
- **Employee Data Management**: CRUD operations for employees stored in a SQL database.
- **Web API**: For deleting employee records via a RESTful API.
- **Search Functionality**: Filter employee records by first name.
- **Contact Us**: A form submission system to send an email with form data.
- **Logout**: Users can log out and be redirected to the home page.

## üè° **Home Page: Authentication & Redirection**

1. **Integrate .NET Core Identity** for **login functionality**:
   - Create an **Identity system** that enables user registration and login.
   - After a successful login, users should be redirected to the **Employees** page.
   - If an **unauthenticated user** tries to access the **Employees** page directly, they should be redirected back to the **Home** page to log in.
